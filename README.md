## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Modular Blocks
*   **Dynamic Options:** Turn any text into a list of options (e.g., `[Day | Night | Sunset]`) to randomize your output.
*   **Instant Reroll:** Generate fresh prompts with one click while keeping your core structure intact.

### 2. Asset Library
*   **Presets:** Save common lists (like "Camera Angles" or "Art Styles") to your personal library for quick access.
*   **Section Templates:** Save entire prompt sections, including labels and options, to reuse complex setups across projects.

### 3. Organized Workflow
*   **Labels:** Use color-coded labels to group parts of your prompt (Subject, Lighting, Style).
*   **Smart Editing:** Move, duplicate, or delete entire sections easily.

## 💾 Data Storage & Safety

**⚠️ Important:** Prismaflow is a **Local-Only** application.

1.  **Local Storage:** 
    All projects, presets, and settings are saved directly in your browser's Local Storage. We do not store your data on any external server.

2.  **Data Permanence:** 
    **Clearing your browser cache or "Site Data" will permanently delete your saved projects.**

3.  **Backup & Transfer:**
    To prevent data loss or to move your projects to another device, you must manually export your data.
    *   **Export:** Click the **Download** icon in the toolbar to save a `.json` backup file of your entire workspace.
    *   **Import:** Click the **Upload** icon to restore your backup on any device or browser.
