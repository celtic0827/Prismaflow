## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Modular Blocks
*   **Dynamic Options:** Turn any text into a list of options (e.g., `[Day | Night | Sunset]`) to randomize your output.
*   **Instant Reroll:** Generate fresh prompts with one click while keeping your core structure intact.

### 2. Asset Library
*   **Presets:** Save common lists (like "Camera Angles" or "Art Styles") to your personal library for quick access.
*   **Section Templates:** Save entire prompt sections, including labels and options, to reuse complex setups across projects.

### 3. Organized Workflow
*   **Labels:** Use color-coded labels to group parts of your prompt (Subject, Lighting, Style).
*   **Smart Editing:** Move, duplicate, or delete entire sections easily.

## 💾 Data Storage & Backup

**Important:** Prismaflow operates entirely within your browser (Client-Side).

*   **Local Storage:** All your projects and settings are stored locally in your browser. No data is sent to any external server, ensuring complete privacy.
*   **Data Safety:** **Clearing your browser cache or site data will permanently delete your saved projects.**
*   **Backup & Transfer:** To keep your data safe or move it to another device, regularly use the **Export Backup** feature (Download icon) in the toolbar. This saves your entire workspace as a `.json` file. You can restore it anytime using **Import Backup** (Upload icon).
