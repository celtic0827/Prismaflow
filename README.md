## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Modular Architecture (模組化架構)
*   **Variable Blocks:** Replace static words with `[Option A | Option B]` blocks.
*   **One-Click Reroll:** Instantly generate new variations based on your defined options without losing the prompt's structure.

### 2. Asset Library (資產圖書館)
*   **Section Templates (New):** Save entire prompt sections (e.g., a complex "Cinematic Lighting" setup involving specific Labels and Blocks) to your library and inject them into any project.
*   **Option Presets:** Build and reuse extensive lists of variables (e.g., "Camera Angles", "Art Styles") across different workflows.

### 3. Prismatic Workflow (光譜流工作流)
*   **Color-Coded Labels:** Visually segment long prompts into logical groups (Subject, Environment, Style).
*   **Structural Editing:** Move, duplicate, or delete entire sections as single units.
*   **Smart Paste:** Intelligently recognizes structured Section data vs. plain text.
