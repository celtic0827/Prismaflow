## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Modular Blocks
*   **Dynamic Options:** Turn any text into a list of options (e.g., `[Day | Night | Sunset]`) to randomize your output.
*   **Instant Reroll:** Generate fresh prompts with one click while keeping your core structure intact.

### 2. Asset Library
*   **Presets:** Save common lists (like "Camera Angles" or "Art Styles") to your personal library for quick access.
*   **Section Templates:** Save entire prompt sections, including labels and options, to reuse complex setups across projects.

### 3. Organized Workflow
*   **Labels:** Use color-coded labels to group parts of your prompt (Subject, Lighting, Style).
*   **Smart Editing:** Move, duplicate, or delete entire sections easily.
